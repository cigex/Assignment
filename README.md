# CL Assignment

Modified files:
- App.js
- firebase.js
- screens/LoginScreen
- screens/HomeScreen


Things that I'd improve:
- regex check for mail
- password power check during signup
- use of "expo constants" for proper display accross multiple devices
- firebase rules for security
- gitignore rules
- better file structure in the project
- flatten data structure in firebase's RTDB instead of Nested
- splash screen to cover up the transition from login screen to home screem, when the app re-opens and the user is logged in
